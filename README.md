MyBarCart is a convenience app for selecting cocktail recipes.  Most of us know what kind of liquor we have at home.  Maybe it's a nice bottle of whiskey you bought last week, maybe it's some college-party-garbage-vodka, maybe it's some Tanqueray.  Beyond the main ingredient or two, most of us couldn't look at a bar cart and say "you could make a Boulevardier or a Negroni from what you already have."

MyBarCart lets you select the items you already have and gives you recipes for cocktails you can make without having to go to the store.
